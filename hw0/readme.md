# Visualization in HCI Homework 0

**Due: Friday, January 20, 11:59 pm.**

Welcome to Visualization in HCI.  In this class, we will be using a variety of tools that will require some initial configuration. To ensure everything goes smoothly moving forward, we will setup the majority of those tools in this homework.

## Class Survey, Signups, and Introduction

### Sign up for github

You'll be using git and [GitHub](http://github.com) to manage homework assignments and projects.

Sign up for a github account (if you don't already have one) and request a free account upgrade [on this page](https://education.github.com/pack). You'll need to verify ownership of an **.edu e-mail address** if you didn't sign up with your .edu account.

This educational student developer pack will enable you to create unlimited private repositories. We will need these for the class.

**It is important that you complete this step quickly, as it may take a while for github to provide you with the repositories.**

### Sign up for Slack
We will use Slack as a forum for discussion, to find team members, to arrange appointments, and to ask questions. Slack should be your primary form of communication with the instructor and other students. Use e-mail only for individual requests, e.g., to inform me if you're sick for an exam, etc. If you ask a general question via e-mail, we will ask you to ask it on Slack instead.

Go to [cmu-vis-course Slack](https://cmu-vis-course.slack.com/signup) and sign up for the class using your CMU e-mail address. If you don't (yet) have an official e-mail address, send an e-mail to [cmu.vis.course@gmail.com](mailto:cmu.vis.course@gmail.com) with the subject "Slack Access: your@e.mail".

### Class Survey
Please complete the [course survey located here](https://goo.gl/forms/NKXnkTksR2cMd9jY2). It should only take a few moments of your time. It is imperative that you fill out the survey on time.

### Introduction

Once you are signed up for Slack, introduce yourself to your classmates and course staff in the #general channel. Include your name/nickname, your affiliation, why you are taking this course, and tell us something interesting about yourself (e.g., an unusual hobby, past travels, or a cool project you did, etc.).  Also tell us whether you have experience with visualization.
